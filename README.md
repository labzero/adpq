# Introduction
The Lab Zero team’s approach to product development and software delivery is very close to the steps outlined in the U.S. Digital Services Playbook. In the abbreviated timeline for this assessment, our team engaged with target users to gain deeper understanding of their needs in order to produce and test designs as solutions. Collaboration between roles let the team choose best-of-breed designs that could be feasibly delivered within the timeline. Our engineers chose modern tools that supported our need to bring features together quickly and deliver them continually through the timeline with a high degree of quality. The team’s high level of rigor in engineering —gleaned from years of experience delivering mission-critical applications—results in code that’s easy to adapt to meet evolving business needs. 

# Setup Instructions

## Installation of requirements

### Software Versions

  * Elixir 1.4.1 (Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.2])
  * Phoenix Framework 1.2.1
  * postgres (PostgreSQL) 9.6.2
  * Node.js 7.5.0
  * React 15.4.2

### MacOS
  1. Install Homebrew if not already installed `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  1. Update Homebrew `brew update`
  1. Install postgresql `brew install postgresql`
  1. Install node `brew install node`
  1. Install elixir `brew install elixir`
  1. Install mix `mix local.hex`
  1. Create PostgreSQL role `createuser -d adpq`
  1. Create and migrate schema `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  1. To add seed data to your database: `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`

### Linux

## Starting the application

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  1. Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  1. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

# Technical Approach

## Architectural Approach
This web application consists of a modern React.js app (Single Page Application) that consumes a JSON API backend written in Elixir using the Phoenix framework backed by a Postgres database. We considered using Shopify or Spree but ultimately decided to build the prototype from scratch. This decision enabled us to demonstrate our ability to develop an easy-to-use application designed in light of careful and deliberate conversations with real users.

## Development Process
We use the GitFlow branching model and create feature branches off of the develop branch for all new changes. All 
commits should adhere to the guidelines described in our [commit guide](https://github.com/labzero/guides/blob/master/process/commit_guide.md). 
Each feature branch is pushed to Github and a pull request is created, built and tested in CircleCI before peer-review 
is performed by other developers on the team. Upon final approval by the dev lead, the branch will be squash-merged back 
into develop.

## CI Process
The CI service checks all Pull Requests and looks for success for all of these steps:
* Compilation and Docker container build
* Credo (code quality/style analyzer)
* Unit tests
* eslint on javascript

## Continuous Delivery
The delivery process relies upon automated movement of code and assets into the test environment triggered by commits to the develop branch. 
* Commits to develop trigger deployment to our Test environment
* Upon deployment, post-deploy automated testing it performed

## Release Process
Using GitFlow tooling, we create a release branch and tag. The tag is then used to create a new container image. A job in CircleCI is used to deploy the tagged container to ECS in AWS.

## Infrastructure Approach
We built the application in a cloud-first manner on AWS, but deployed it in a Docker container in order to allow cloud portability. However, if AWS offers a managed service for something we need, we prefer the managed service to rolling our own infrastructure, i.e. Postgres via RDS instead of running our own Postgres servers in EC2. 

We maintain our VPC and security blueprints as CloudFormation templates checked into Git.
